    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p> Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p></li>
        <li><p> Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p></li>
        <li><p>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</p></li>
    </ul>
